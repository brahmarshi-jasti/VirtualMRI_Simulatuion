# Phantom Image Generation Using Modified Coordinates

## Introduction

This project generates phantom images using a custom MATLAB function based on modified coordinates for ellipses. The generated phantom images are displayed and saved, and include variations like overlapped ellipses, non-overlapped ellipses, additional circular structures, and concentric circles.

## Files
- **generate_modified_phantom.m**: MATLAB function to generate phantom images based on modified coordinates.

OUTPUT FILES
This project outputs several phantom images in .png format:

- **phantom_modified_overlap.png**: Image with overlapping ellipses.
- **phantom_modified_no_overlap.png**: Image with non-overlapping ellipses.
- **phantom_with_circles.png**: Image with two additional circular structures.
- **phantom_image_3_concentric.png**: Image with three concentric circles.

## Usage

1. download the code.
2. Open MATLAB.
3. Make sure the current working directory is set to the location where the files are located.
4. Run the script in MATLAB to generate the images.
